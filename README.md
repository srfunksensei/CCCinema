# CCCinema

The task is to build a simple web interface that allows a user to purchase cinema tickets for selected movies.

The following are the criteria for the task:
  * The intended cinema has many theatres
  * Each theatre has many seats, configured in a rectangular fashion, i.e. each row has equal number of seats
  * Each theatre has a number of movies that are shown every day

Your project should include the following:
  * Java should be used as the main server side programming language
  * An appropriate domain model (this model does not need to be persisted, but needs to be seeded from appropriate configuration files or a data fixture provider)
  * A web interface that provides the following:
    - Allows a user to view the upcoming movies
    - A way for the user to book a seat of their choice for a selected movie.
  * The system is built in a manner that it can be accessed from multiple devices (only web based access is required for the purpose of this project).
  * Data consistency should be guaranteed.
  * The use of Spring, Spring MVC will be considered an asset.
